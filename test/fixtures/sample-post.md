A month ago, we posted a beta of the new React developer tools. Today, we&#39;re releasing the first stable version of the new devtools. We&#39;re calling it version 0.14, but it&#39;s a full rewrite so we think of it more like a 2.0 release.



It contains a handful of new features, including:


Built entirely with React, making it easier to develop and extend
Firefox support
Selected component instance is available as $r from the console
More detail is shown in props in the component tree...
